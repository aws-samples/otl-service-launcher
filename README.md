Use this on OTL test accounts.

This will create two VPCs in your account with public and private subnets. One VPC will have two subnets in-region and two subnets on your Outpost. The other VPC will have two subnets in-region and will come with a VGW pre-provisioned; you can manually connect the VGW to your on-prem network and from there to the Outpost's LGW.
